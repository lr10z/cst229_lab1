# cst229_lab1
A program that acts as a Deterministic Finite Automata Machine

Included Files:
1. main.cpp -  A C++ file that holds the main program
2. machine.h - A C++ header file that holds a class
3. machine.cpp - A C++ file that implements the class from the machine.h file
4. machine1.txt - A text file used as input for the Deterministic Finite Automata Machine program
5. machine2.txt - A text file used as input for the Deterministic Finite Automata Machine program
6. machine3.txt - A text file used as input for the Deterministic Finite Automata Machine program

Instructions:
1. All files should be entered/opened together with an IDE that compiles C++ files
2. Once entered into a C++ IDE, start the program and follow the on-screen instructions

Input File Format:
0 1     // machine states
0       // language alphabet
0       // starting state
0       // final states
0 0 1   // transition function
1 0 0   // transition function
